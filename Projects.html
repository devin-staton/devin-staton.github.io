        <h4>Database</h4>
        <p>
            A group project in MIS where my team implemented a database for a fictional company. We constructed an ERD and built
            the SQL queries for a fully operational company-wide database.

        <h4>Nike Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            As an intern, I analyzed retail store data from across the world to find business drivers and growth
            opportunities for Nike, concluded by a presentation to the VP of my team recommending future business strategy.

        <h4>Webpage</h4>
        <p>
            In one of my MIS classes, I learned how to make webpages using many different programs including WPF, HTML,
            CSS, and MVC. I also became proficient in C# and JSON while building these real-world projects.

        <h4>Investment</h4>
        <p>
            In my Finance minor coursework, I managed a semester-long portfolio of stocks as part of a team of four.  We competed against
            33 other teams and finished 2nd in overall profit at the end of the semester.

        <h4>Research Paper</h4>
        <p>
            In my "Religion & Pop Culture" Honors class, I wrote a 27 pg research over "College Football as a Religion". This paper
            explored how college football transcends sport, making it pseudo-religious to many participants.

        <h4>SAP Simulation</h4>
        <p>
            Along with a team, I ran an ERP simulation in my MIS class using SAP. We were tasked with asdjusting business strategy
            over a twenty day period to maximize profit, and my team finished in first place.
