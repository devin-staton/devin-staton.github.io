        <p>I am currently an Honors student at the University of Oklahoma majoring in Management Information Systems with a minor in 
        Finance. I am also a walk-on for the Sooners football team where I play wide receiver. My GPA is a perfect 4.0, and I have 
        been selected twice to the Academic All-Big 12 team. I am originally from Houston, Texas
        where I was a Boy Scout, earning the rank of Eagle Scout for my leadership and volunteering efforts.</p>
